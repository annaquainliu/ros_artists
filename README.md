# Ros Artists

Goal: Create a Python project using the library ROS that programs multiple robots to 
concurrently draw an image. 

Potential Ideas:
- Robots can swap their drawing instruments with arms.
- Arms or turtle bots can be used, or both, which can introduce more concurrency in a project. Arms can help simplify geometry and have a better fixed drawing instrument.
- 2-3 turtlebots can have their own colors, none of them should interfere with each other.
